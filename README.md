# DriverPass-Portfolio
For this project our client was a company by the name of DriverPass. They wanted a system design that would allow customers to reserve appointments with them in order to help them pass their drivers test on the first try. The design we came up with will allow updates from DMV on rules and regulations to make sure DriverPass ensures they teach everything. The system will also allow users to schedule change or cancel appointments they have created as well as choose from particular packages on what they would like to get out of DriverPass. I believe that my case designs were done well and achieved all of the goals DriverPass wanted to achieve with this project. If I had something I thought could of been done better that would be project 1 the business reqs document was not complete so I would definitely revise that. User needs are super important because without users there is no point in having the software. I read the interview script and used it as a guide to make sure I implemented all the things they asked for into this project. I found it best to go through and find all the requirements first and write them down separately. This way while designing the project I can mark them off as implemented to ensure all of them are done by the time the project it ready to be submitted. This mehod seemed to work well for me and I would use it in the future maybe even implementing more as I learn more.
